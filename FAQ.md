INSTALLATION
------------

###1. Error on compiling filter in c++ with opencv.
Example, with the filter ScipyExample.py.
Do you install opencv-dev? Is this repertory exist: /usr/local/include/opencv
If not, maybe you need this: sudo ln -s /usr/include/opencv /usr/local/include/opencv

###2. Error when recording video.
Maybe you need to compile opencv with ffmpeg. Be sure you install ffmpeg dependance.
About fedora package, follow this: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812628
